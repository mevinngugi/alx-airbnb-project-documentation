# 2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

**Objective:** Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**

Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”

Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.

Create a file named <mark>user-stories.md</mark> in the directory <mark>user-stories/</mark> within your GitHub repository <mark>alx-airbnb-project-documentation</mark> and document your user stories there.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository
